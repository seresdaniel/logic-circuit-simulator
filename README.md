Logic Circuit Simulator
This is a simple web-based logic circuit simulator.
You can add, connect, and label various logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR, NOT), inputs, and outputs using your mouse or touch.
Gates and wires can be deleted, and the entire circuit can be saved to or loaded from a file.
Double-click a gateâ€™s label to edit it; click elsewhere to save changes.
All logic and truth tables are calculated correctly, making it suitable for educational use.
